# Launching the project

After obtaining a copy of the project on your local machine navigate to the cloned directory using a terminal application.

Ensure that you have Java JDK, Maven and Node.js installed and available on your path.

Using the terminal navigate to test-api directory.

Execute command "mvn spring-boot:run" and the project will launch.

Open another terminal, then navigate to test-web directory and execute commands "npm install" and "npm start", after which the web portion of the project will launch.

Alternatively, open this project using your IDEs of choice for Java and Javascript/Typescript and use the built-in tools of said IDEs to launch the project.

After that, navigate to http://localhost:4200 in your browser and explore app functionality.
